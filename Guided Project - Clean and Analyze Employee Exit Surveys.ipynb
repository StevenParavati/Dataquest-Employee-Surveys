    "# Employee Exit Surveys\n",

    "## Dataset Explanation\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). Some slight modifications to these datasets were made to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is what was noted:\n",
    "- Since the cease_date is the last year of the person's employment and the dete_start_date is the person's first year of employment, it wouldn't make sense to have years after the current date.\n",
    "- Given that most people in this field start working in their 20s, it's also unlikely that the dete_start_date was before the year 1940.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are many years higher than the current date or lower than 1940, we would want to stop with the analysis, because it could mean there's something very wrong with the data. If there are a small amount of values that are unrealistically high or low, we can remove them with minimal impact to the analysis."
